full stack web developer :D
(That's my first github acc.)

The reason why I created this account is because I was bored and needed a place to store some small projects.
I will share the projects I made according to my mind. In addition, the projects I do will mainly be web-based projects.

I am proficient in the following programming languages:
1- Javascript
2- Nodejs
3- React
4- PHP
5- CSS
6- HTML (if it counts as a software language :D)
7- Python

(In addition, I have extensive knowledge in areas such as API technologies and website security.)
